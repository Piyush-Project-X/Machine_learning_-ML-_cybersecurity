# Machine_learning_-ML-_cybersecurity
This project was my first foray into machine learning during my junior year of undergraduate studies. I initially implemented the logistic regression algorithm and recently updated it to train on nearly half a million URLs classified as malicious and benign.

Problem Statement:
Significance of URL Classification: In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of malicious URLs poses a significant threat to cybersecurity. These URLs can lead unsuspecting users to phishing sites, malware downloads, or other malicious activities. Identifying and classifying URLs accurately as malicious or benign is crucial for protecting individuals and organizations from cyber threats.

Impact of Malicious URLs: Clicking on a malicious URL can compromise sensitive information, lead to financial loss, or result in unauthorized access to devices and networks. Preventing such incidents is paramount to maintaining cybersecurity hygiene and safeguarding digital assets.

Implementation Approach:
Understanding URL Characteristics: Analyzed and visualized URL features to extract meaningful patterns for classification.
Model Development: Built a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF vectorization(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for URL classification.
User Interface: Developed a Tkinter-based GUI for real-time URL classification, enabling users to assess the safety of web links instantly.

Outcome:
Delivered a reliable URL classification tool with a focus on user accessibility and cybersecurity awareness, contributing to digital safety practices.









During my junior year of bachelor's studies, I embarked on my first machine learning project. This experience was pivotal as it served as my foundational introduction to the principles and practical applications of machine learning algorithms.

Learning Process: 
I initially studied fundamental concepts such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation metrics specific to logistic regression.

Implementation: 
I applied my learning to develop an initial version of the logistic regression algorithm, which formed the core of my project.
