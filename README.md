# Malicious_URL_detection_using_Machine_learning_cybersecurity

This project was my first foray into machine learning during my junior year of undergraduate studies. I initially implemented the logistic regression algorithm and recently updated it to train on nearly half a million URLs classified as malicious and benign.

1. Problem Statement:
Significance of URL Classification: In today's digital landscape, the multiplication of malicious URLs poses a significant threat to cybersecurity. These URLs can lead unsuspecting users to phishing sites, malware downloads, or other malicious activities. Identifying and classifying URLs accurately as malicious or benign is crucial for protecting individuals and organizations from cyber threats.

2. Implementation Approach:
Understanding URL Characteristics: Analyzed and visualized URL features to extract meaningful patterns for classification.
Model Development: Built a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF vectorization(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for URL classification.
User Interface: Developed a Tkinter-based GUI for real-time URL classification, enabling users to assess the safety of web links instantly.

3. Outcome:
Delivered a reliable URL classification tool with a focus on user accessibility and cybersecurity awareness, contributing to digital safety practices.
