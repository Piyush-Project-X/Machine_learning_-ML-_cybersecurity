# Malicious URL Detection using Machine Learning in Cybersecurity

This project marked my entry into machine learning during my junior year of undergraduate studies. Initially implementing the logistic regression algorithm, I later enhanced it to train on nearly half a million URLs classified as malicious and benign.

## Problem Statement

**1. Significance of URL Classification:**
In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of malicious URLs poses a significant cybersecurity threat. These URLs can direct unsuspecting users to phishing sites, malware downloads, or other malicious activities. Accurate classification of URLs as malicious or benign is critical for protecting individuals and organizations from cyber threats.

## Implementation Approach

**2. Methodology:**
- **Understanding URL Characteristics:** Analyzed and visualized URL features to extract meaningful patterns for classification.
- **Model Development:** Employed Logistic Regression using TF-IDF vectorization (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for URL classification.
- **User Interface:** Developed a Tkinter-based GUI for real-time URL classification, enhancing user ability to assess web link safety instantly.

## Outcome

**3. Achievements:**
Delivered a robust URL classification tool emphasizing user accessibility and promoting cybersecurity awareness, thereby bolstering digital safety practices.

## Skills Gained

**4. Skills Acquired:**
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning Modeling
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- GUI Development (Tkinter)
- Cybersecurity Awareness

*Note: Due to GitHub's file size limit, I reduced the dataset's size before adding it to the repository.*
